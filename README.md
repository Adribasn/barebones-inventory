# barebones-inventory
As the name implies, a bare-bones inventory web app featuring a functioning login/sign-up system, as well as an inventory management system.

Made in Python using Flask for the back-end and Bootstrap 5 for the front-end.
The purpose of this project was to build a solid base of knowledge regarding
web-apps for future projects. It wasn't particularly difficult compared to 
some of my other projects but I always prefer to learn to walk before I 
try to run. Now that I've accomplished this objective I can turn myself towards
more ambitious and complex projects with the reassurance that I didn't skip over the basics.
